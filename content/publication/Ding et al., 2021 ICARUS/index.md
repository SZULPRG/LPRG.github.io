  Ground penetrating radar has recently been used to detect subsurface structures of extraterrestrial bodies, but in situ physical properties (permittivity, density, porosity, etc.) of planetary materials are not well constrained, so that geological interpretations for a given radar observation can be widely different. Hyperbolic reflectors in radargrams obtained by ground penetrating radars are caused by subsurface materials that have a different permittivity, and these reflectors are important agent to deduce the physical properties of materials at smaller depths. The geometry of hyperbolic reflectors is critical for such calculations. Manual extraction, image analyses, and peak echoes have been used to extract the geometry of hyperbolic reflectors, but uncertainties caused by these different methods have not been systematically investigated. Here we compare differences caused by the three methods based on both modelled and observed hyperbolic reflectors in radargrams. Our results suggest that minor differences in the extracted geometry could yield significant uncertainty in the estimated bulk permittivities, leading to dramatically different interpretations. For the interpretation of the top-most radargram that was obtained by the high-frequency lunar penetrating radar onboard the Chang'E-3 mission, uncertainties caused by the different extraction techniques are trivial. However, for radargrams obtained by both the Chang'E-4 and the first Chinese Mars missions, uncertainties of depth estimations can be tens of meters based on the different extraction methods. Such uncertainties should be considered as the minimum inherent uncertainty of radar detection, because hyperbolic reflectors in radargrams are formed by peak echoes of reflected electromagnetic waves, and in actual worlds, their geometry normally deviates from ideal forms of hyperbolas. We recommend extracting hyperbolas using the peak echo method.
