  It is generally believed that the top centimeters of mature lunar regolith should be dominated by fine particles that contain few rocky fragments, but surface fragments are occasionally visible in mature lunar regolith. Based on amplitudes of surface echoes received by the Lunar Penetrating Radar onboard the Yutu-2 rover of the Chang'E-4 mission, we extracted regions with abnormally high relative permittivity that is larger than 4, quantifying the abundance of dense fragments within the top âˆ¼4 cm of the mature regolith along the rover path. We carried out high-resolution numerical simulations for the propagation of electromagnetic waves, showing that the abnormally high relative permittivity is not caused by local topography but due to the existence of dense materials. Using high-resolution images obtained by the panorama camera
