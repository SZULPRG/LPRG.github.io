abstract: "The radar equipment carried by the Chang’E-3 (CE-3) mission marked the first deployment of rover-mounted ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to observe the lunar surface. This provided an unparalleled opportunity for a high-resolution investigation into the fine structure of the lunar regolith. This article has revealed the presence of multiple discrete layers within the top 4 m of the lunar regolith using high-frequency radar data from the CE-3 Yutu rover. Subsequently, we have established realistic models of the lunar regolith to obtain the radar simulation calculated by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technology. Thus, we compare the simulated radar data with actual observational data to comprehensively confirm the existence of multiple discrete layers within the lunar regolith. Taking into consideration the geological context of the CE-3 landing site and the principles of impact crater formation, we infer that the origin of the multiple discrete layers within the top 4 m of the CE-3 landing site is likely the by-product of multiple depositions of ejecta from nearby small craters. Our findings suggest the possibility of the widespread existence of multiple discrete layers within the lunar regolith and emphasize the significant contribution of ejecta from small impact craters to the accumulation of local lunar regolith thickness on the Moon’s surface."
