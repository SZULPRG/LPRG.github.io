abstract: "On January 3, 2019, Chang'E-4 (CE-4) landed in the Von Kármán crater within the South pole-Aitken Basin on the Moon's farside. The lunar penetrating radar (LPR) onboard the Yutu-2 rover is the same as the Chang 'E-3 mission, which can obtain information about the thickness and strutures of lunar regolith as well as upper crust along the excursion path. The permittivity of lunar material is one of the important parameters for interpreting radar data and can also be obtained by LPR. In this paper, we use the metal plate reflection method based on LPR data and panoramic camera (PC) data to estimate the relative permittivity distribution of 1373m route during the first 53 lunar days. We estimated an average relative permittivity of ~2.78, which is less than ~2.9 of Chang'E-3 (CE-3)."
