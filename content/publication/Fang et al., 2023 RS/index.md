abstract: "China accomplished a historic milestone in 2020 when the mission Chang’e-5 (CE-5) to the Lunar’s surface was successfully launched. An extraordinary component of this mission is the “Lunar Regolith Penetrating Radar” (LRPR) housed within its lander, which currently stands as the most advanced payload in terms of vertical resolution among all penetrating radars employed in lunar exploration. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for high-precision research into the interior structure of the shallow lunar regolith. Previous studies have achieved fruitful research results based on the data from LRPR, updating our perception of the shallow-level regolith of the Moon. This paper provides an overview of the new advancements achieved by the LRPR in observing the basic structure of the shallow regolith of the Moon. It places special emphasis on the role played by the LRPR in revealing details about the shallow lunar regolith’s structure, its estimated dielectric properties, the provenance of the regolith materials from the landing area, and its interpretation of the geological stratification at the landing site. Lastly, it envisions the application and developmental trends of in situ radar technology in future lunar exploration."
