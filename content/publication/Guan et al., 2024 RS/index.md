abstract: "Nowadays, asteroid and comet exploration is one of the most important components of deep space exploration. Through asteroid and comet exploration missions, it is possible to reveal the history of the formation and evolution of the solar system, to understand the origin and evolution of the planets, and to improve scientific models and instruments. As a payload with the advantages of non-destructive, penetrating, and polarizing characteristics, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has been widely used in lunar and Mars exploration, and will play an important role in planned asteroid and comet exploration missions. In this study, statistics on asteroid and comet exploration missions, scientific results, and space-based ground-penetrating radar (SB-GPR) utilization are presented for the three phases to date. According to the statistics, SB-GPR will play an important role in future Phase 2 and 3 missions. The focus of this study is on analyzing the mission flow, SB-GPR parameters, scientific objectives, and scientific results of the missions that have carried SB-GPR and those that are planned to carry SB-GPR, including the Hera, Rosetta, Castalia, and Tianwen-2 missions. On this basis, the development trends of asteroid and comet exploration missions, as well as the future development trends of SB-GPR design and signal interpretation, are discussed."
