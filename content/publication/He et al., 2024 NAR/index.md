abstract: "Although the Ku-band Cassini RADAR was not primarily designed to probe Titan’s subsurface structure, it unexpectedly provided valuable data on penetration, notably measuring the depth and dielectric properties of several lakes or seas in altimetry mode. While the RADAR did not possess the same penetration capability as the radar instruments that are used to search for water on Mars, its detection results and potential still warrant comprehensive integration and summary. This paper reviews the latest research findings on Titan’s subsurface observations, encompassing liquid bodies and dunes, grounded on RADAR’s penetration performance and principles. In consideration of the Dragonfly mission and its scientific goals, the paper reviews the distribution of water ice on Titan. The upcoming observations hold promise for investigating relevant features at low latitudes, such as impact craters with exposed ice-rich material. Finally, suggestions and prospects for future subsurface radar exploration of Titan are presented. The exploration of subsurface structures on Titan remains a captivating field of study, bearing significant implications for planetary science and astrobiology."
