abstract: |
  The MOSIR (Mars Orbiter Subsurface Investigation Radar) is one of the scientific payloads carried by the Tianwen-1 orbiter. MOSIR conducted a ground experiment in the desert near Dengkou County, northern China, before the launch of the Tianwen-1 satellite. The MOSIR prototype was suspended from a hot air balloon and flew over a flat region at an altitude of 2500â€“3300 m. This experiment aimed to verify the system performance and data processing. The data collected in subsurface sounding mode is performed range compression, and the altitude measurement data removes invalid data. After processing, the altitude measurement results of two operating modes are analyzed and compared with that of the Global Position System (GPS), which verifies the accuracy of the altitude measurement.
