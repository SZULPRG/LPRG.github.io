abstract: "Mars Orbiter Subsurface Investigation Radar (MOSIR) is carried by China's first Mars probe, Tianwen-1 orbiter, investigating the Martian subsurface stratification. Surface clutter from topography off-nadir will overlap with the subsurface echoes, which affects the recognition of Martian subsurface reflections. Surface clutter simulation can effectively distinguish the nadir and off-nadir radar echoes. In this paper, we choose the facet method to model the Mars surface topography and combine the roughness parameter with the radar backscatter function. We also provide an analytic expression of the echo phase considering the distance variation in the whole facet. The Chinese first Mars landing site is on Utopia Planitia, which is also one of the key investigating regions of MOSIR. Therefore, we also carried on surface clutter simulation of this region and generated simulation radargram with the Chirp Scaling algorithm. Furthermore, we use the contrast method to compensate for ionospheric error introduced by the NeMars Mars ionosphere model. Our surface clutter simulation program will significantly support MOSIR subsurface investigation, and provide a chance to verify the related data processing."
