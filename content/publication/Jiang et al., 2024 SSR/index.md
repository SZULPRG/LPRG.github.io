abstract: "The Tianwen-1 mission, marking China’s inaugural venture into Mars exploration, successfully deployed the Zhurong rover on Utopia Planitia. This review primarily focuses on the insights provided by the Mars Rover Penetrating Radar (RoPeR), a pivotal component of the mission’s scientific payload. The article synthesizes the RoPeR findings with an emphasis on the geological evolution and potential habitability of the Zhurong rover landing site. The study meticulously investigates the genesis and spatial distribution of water ice within Utopia Planitia, establishing correlations with the Martian climatic and hydrological history, the formation of typical landforms and mineral evidence associated with water ice/liquid water of this region. It further discusses the potential habitability of Mars’ subsurface in the current environmental context. This review also expatiates the techniques used in the analysis of RoPeR data, including the methodology for processing polarimetric radar data and the inversion of the dielectric properties of the Martian subsurface. Through this comprehensive review, we aim to present a cohesive picture of the Tianwen-1 mission’s findings, particularly the Zhurong rover results, and their implications for understanding Mars’ geological past, water ice, and assessing its habitability."
