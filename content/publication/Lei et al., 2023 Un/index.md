abstract: "China has successfully carried out five lunar exploration missions since 2007. These missions indicate that China has successfully implemented a three-step lunar exploration program of “orbiting, landing, and returning”. Among them, the Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) carried by the Yutu-2 rover in the Chang’E-4 (CE-4) mission is the only one still operating on the far side of the Moon. Up to now, the Yutu-2 radar has measured a large amount of scientific data, and its observations are of great significance to human cognition of the geological evolution of the lunar surface and the exploration of possible lunar in situ resources. This paper reviews the scientific results obtained by previous researchers based on the radar exploration data of Yutu-2, focusing mainly on three aspects, e.g., the geological structure of the shallow surface at the CE-4 landing site, the dielectric properties of the shallow subsurface materials and the special geological features. Finally, the prospects of Yutu-2 radar research priorities and future exploration, and the application trend of Moon-based ground-penetrating radar are given."
