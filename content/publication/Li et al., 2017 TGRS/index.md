abstract: |
  Chang'e-3 (CE-3) has been the first spacecraft to soft land on the moon since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 in 1976. The spacecraft arrived at Mare Imbrium on December 14, 2013, and the same day, Yutu lunar rover separated from lander to start its exploration of the surface and the subsurface around the landing site. The rover was equipped, among other instruments, with two lunar penetrating radar systems having a working frequency of 60 and 500 MHz. The radars acquired data for about two weeks while the rover was slowly moving along a path of about 114 m. At navigation point N0209, the rover got stacked into the lunar soil and after that only data at a fixed position could be collected. The low-frequency radar data have been analyzed by different authors and published in two different papers, which reported totally controversial interpretations of the radar cross sections. This paper is devoted to resolve such controversy by carefully analyzing and comparing the data collected on the moon by Yutu rover and on earth by a prototype of LPR mounted onboard a model of the CE-3 lunar rover. Such analysis demonstrates that the deep radar features previously ascribed to the lunar shallow stratigraphy are not real reflectors, rather they are signal artifacts probably generated by the system and its electromagnetic interaction with the metallic rover.
