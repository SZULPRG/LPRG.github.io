abstract: "This study analyzes CE-5 lander thermal sensor data and develops lunar thermal models to quantify environmental impacts. Key findings include: 1) Surface temperatures at the landing site increased from 341.40 K to 356.15 K during measurements, exceeding Diviner orbital data by 6-12 K; 2) A heat conduction model achieved <3.36 K RMSE in fitting sensor records; 3) Thermal environment significantly affected both shaded (ΔT >30 K) and sunlit lander surfaces, with greater impact on shaded areas during measurement period. Results advance lunar thermal management design and in-situ data interpretation."
