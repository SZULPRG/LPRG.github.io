abstract: "Determining the mineral components of the lunar regolith is key to understanding the Moon’s genesis and evolution. This study proposes a sparse unmixing method based on spectral libraries to analyze Chang’E-5 LMS data. Results show the regolith composition includes agglutinates/glass (49.36%), pyroxene (14.08%), plagioclase (18.58%), ilmenite (16.11%), and olivine (1.86%), with 79.83% of particles <75 μm. Space weathering effects vary by mineral, and in-situ spectral evidence reveals water content averaging 67 ppm (up to 201 ppm in rocks). The method enables simultaneous detection of mineral end-members, abundances, and particle sizes, advancing lunar resource characterization."
