  Stratigraphic structure of the lunar surface is critical for understanding the geology and impact history of the Moon. On 3 January 2019, China’s Chang’E-4 (CE-4) successfully landed on the eastern floor of Von Kármán crater within the South Pole-Aitken Basin (SPA), becoming the first spacecraft in history with a controlled landing on the farside of the Moon. Yutu-2 rover traveled for ~345 m during the first twelve lunar day period with the Lunar Penetrating Radar (LPR) observing along the traverse. The LPR is an ultra-wide band impulse ground penetrating radar, operating at two center frequencies of 60 and 500 MHz. Here we report the observations of the LPR. The high frequency channel (500MHz) detected the subsurface structure at the depth of ~40 m. The penetration depth is more than three times as deep as that at the Chang’E-3 (CE-3) landing site, indicating low loss materials at the CE-4 landing site. The section, from the surface to a depth of ~40 m, is divided into three units, showing alternating bright and dark echo strength and imbeded with large rocks. The layers might be non-uniform ejecta of large craters surrounding Von Kármán crater and homogeneous paleoregolith of weathered ejecta. All these evidences imply a very complex impact history over the Moon’s farside.
