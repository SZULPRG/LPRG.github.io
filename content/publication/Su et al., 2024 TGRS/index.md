abstract: "This article investigates the Martian subsurface in the Utopia Planitia region using Zhurong’s ground-penetrating radar. A customized signal processing pipeline minimizes artifacts in radargrams and generates subsoil images revealing a three-layer structure up to ~40 m depth: 5∼8-m regolith, 2∼3-m fine materials, and 15∼30-m block-embedded layers. Grain size decreases upward, indicating long-term weathering and impact/flood events. Enhanced scattering from Sol 292 to 325 correlates with barchan dunes and crater distributions, suggesting tectonic-impacts resurfacing. The study provides the first quantitative electromagnetic characterization of Utopia Planitia's shallow subsurface using Tianwen-1 radar data."
