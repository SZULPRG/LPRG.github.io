abstract: |
  Lunar Penetration Radar (LPR), one of important scientific payloads of Chang'e-3 Yutu rover, has successfully acquired a large amount of scientific data, which are very useful to interpret the thickness of lunar regolith and the structure of lunar subsurface. The ultimate penetration depth means the maximum detection performance of LPR and it is significant in noise suppression and layer recognition. Considering the limitations of traditional depth estimated methods in ground penetrating radar field, a new method termed as Correlation Coefficient Method (CCM) is provided in this study, which is only based on radar data. Using the different correlations of the reflected echoes and noise between adjacent traces, the CCM can estimate the penetration depth from the radar data. The principle and detailed procedures of CCM are described and the CCM is verified as an effective method to estimate the penetration depth through a simulation. The estimated depth of the 500 MHz LPR profile from N0201 to N0208 indicates that the penetration time delay is from 92.5 ns to 166.9 ns and the ultimate penetration depth has reached 16.5 m in this profile with the relative permittivity of the lunar regolith of 2.3.
