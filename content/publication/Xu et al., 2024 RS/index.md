abstract: "Lunar exploration is of significant importance in the development and utilization of in situ lunar resources, water ice exploration, and astronomical science. In recent years, ground-based radar (GBR) has gained increasing attention in the field of lunar exploration due to its flexibility, low cost, and penetrating capabilities. This paper reviews the scientific research on lunar exploration using GBR, outlining the basic principles of GBR and the progress made in lunar exploration studies. Our paper introduces the fundamental principles of lunar imaging using GBR and systematically reviews studies on lunar surface/subsurface detection, the dielectric properties inversion of the lunar regolith, and polar water ice detection using GBR. In particular, the paper summarizes the current development status of the Chinese GBR and forecasts future development trends in China. This review will enhance the understanding of lunar exploration results using GBR radar, systematically demonstrate the main applications and scientific achievements of GBR in lunar exploration, and provide a reference for GBR radar in future lunar exploration missions."
