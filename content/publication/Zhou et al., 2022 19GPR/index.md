abstract: "The lunar penetrating radar (LPR) onboard the Chang’E-4 (CE-4) probe provides a unique opportunity to map the shallow lunar structures on the far side of the Moon with high resolution. Numerous previous studies have been carried out to reveal the subsurface fine structure of the CE-4 landing site and the complex geological evolution of the region. However, due to the timed-triggered acquisition mode, the LPR kept acquiring data when the rover was turning and stopped. In previous studies, the repeated data measured at one same location was usually averaged into one single trace and then stitched into the radargram. In this study, we innovatively extracted the polarimetric scattering matrix from the data acquired at different orientations at the same location during rover turning. The three-components Pauli attributes (α, β, and γ) in radar polarimetry are obtained. The results of polarization imaging and the spectral of polarimetric signals show good consistency with the common LPR radargram."
